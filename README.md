# Eat Da Burger using Sequelized

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

The app will display orders in the UI; allow users to "devour" them when ready; and store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

It uses models, routes, views...etc., telling everything how to work together and interact
